# Project Status

* Core data pulls (GDP, ICD-10, and population) have been made and uploaded to the Core Data Pulls folder.

*A Starter Notebook has been provided to automate the process of reading the data into memory, but you will need to download and put into your working directory the two WHO Mortality datasets (they're too big to upload and didn't come across).*

* Relevant documentation about datasets and methodologies reside in the Documentation folder; file names are non-descriptive, as they have to be changed.

* Datasets pertaining to correlative factors (i.e., air quality and happiness) can be found in the Correlative Factors folder.

* Created a .csv file (Mortality Cause Code Descriptions) containing Mortality Cause Code, ICD-10 Code(s), and Cause Description from the Mortality dataset documentation (pp. 39-41); located in Core Data Pulls folder

* Created Age Code Description .csv files (for both Population and Mortality) from the Mortality dataset documentation, as age grouping varies by 'Frmat' code; located in Core Data Pulls folder

**Happy exploring!**
